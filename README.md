# Inspiration
It is a known fact that the environment is rapidly deteriorating. As we progress through each day, we release an astronomical amount of fossil fuels into the atmosphere. We need to focus on reducing consumption in order to alleviate this problem. We designed EcoHome to provide people with more environmentally friendly options at their homes.

# What it does
A user will take a survey regarding their home appliances/home conditions. The website will then provide a personalized plan for individuals to lead them on the path to the most environmentally friendly home. The website will also provide how many suggestions other users have finished to inspire the respective user. There will be a leaderboard that will show who has the most environmentally friendly home.

# How we built it
To build EcoHome, we used angular and the Google Maps API. We also used firebase and tailwind CSS.

# Challenges we ran into
Implementing the navigation api was a struggle, but once we got over that hurdle we were set.

# Accomplishments that we are proud of
We are proud that this app can be deployed in the real world with practical use. This app can genuinely show many people more environmentally friendly products that they donâ€™t about. It will help alleviate the amount of fossil fuels being released into the environment while also helping the user save money.

# What we learned
We learnt about how the environment is deteriorating more rapidly than what many people think. We also learned that teamwork is fundamental when trying to put together a product within a short span of time.

# What's next for EcoHome
We plan on expanding EcoHome by partnering with appliance retailers such as Home Depot. They can use our platform as a way to market their environmentally friendly appliances that they sell. We also plan on building a large user base through social media to expand the number of people who help us reach our environmental goals.
